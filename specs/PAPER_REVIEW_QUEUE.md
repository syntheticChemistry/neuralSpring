## Notes

- Paper 11 is the single most important paper in the entire ecosystem — it externally validates the constrained evolution methodology
- Papers 16-18 (Liu) bridge neuralSpring to wetSpring's metagenomics work
- Papers 19-21 (Waters) connect optimization theory to real biological dynamics
- Dolson papers (11-15) form a coherent sequence from theory → metrics → applications
- All candidate papers use computational methods reproducible in Python/PyTorch before Rust evolution
